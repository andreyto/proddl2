Pascal mercier STC run
This example demonstrates the use of a custom built sconf file for the enzyme
and some errors.

1) Click on "calc ASA" button.

2) Press "calculate" button.
    Done calculations, display results, log file has some errors.

3) Click 'Display results' and view log file to see these errors:

	*** Error, Unrecognized residue name:     850 CA   CA   160     14.26200 15.32000  31.72200      1.9000
	*** Error, Unrecognized atom name:     851 CA   CA   161     18.80500 7.03500  24.55600      1.9000

	Let's say we choose to ignore these errors for now.
    Click "Dismiss".

4) Click "Thermodynamics" button.

5) Press "Calculate". This time thermo complains about the calcium atoms
in the pdb file. Quit stc and go to pm.complex.pdb and remove the 
offending atoms (bottom of the file). You can also comment them out by
using the "#" function at the start of each line.

6) Re-start STC and re-do the calc-asa calculations.

7) Click the "Thermodynamics" button.

8) This time we press both "calculate from datafile" radio buttons.
This allows us to use the values found in the file pm.enzyme.sconf.

9) Press "Calculate". Click "Dismiss" when you are done viewing results.
