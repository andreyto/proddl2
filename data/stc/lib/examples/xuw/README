This example demonstrates the use of a custom built amino.def file for
the EMD residue.

1) Note that I have used the "stc.defaults" file to set the
"Residue Library" to "custom.amino.def".  Look at
this file to see how we added the EMD entity. 

2) Click on "calc ASA" button.

3) Press "calculate" button.
    Done calculations, no errors. 

4) Click "Dismiss" if you are interested in viewing these intermediate files.

5) Click "Thermodynamics" button.

6) Press "Calculate". Click "Dismiss" when you are done viewing results.
