This example shows how to use the batch button to process
several pdb files (although only 3 in this case).

When stc starts, press the "batch" button and then "calculate".
All files with a '.pdb' suffix are processed, calculating ASA
is done first and then thermodynamic calculations.

Basic results are found in the '*.basic' output files,
detailed results in '*.detail'.
