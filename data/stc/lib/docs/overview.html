<H2> STC Overview <HR> </H2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">STC performs free energy calculations from the
structure of the different complexes in a graphical user interface.
We have compiled executable versions for sgi, sun and linux PC which
are accessible for free at the PENCE-MRC software download site.
<P>
In essence STC consists of two modules.
The first module, <B>calc_asa</B>, calculates the change in 
accessible surface area (ASA) for
the dissociation process from the coordinate files in the Brookhaven
protein data bank (pdb) format using the algorithm
ANAREA (Richmond, 1984) as implemented in the
program VADAR (Wishart et al.,1994). The output files consists of the 
tabulated ASA of each atom of the complex, both the free
forms of the enzyme and the ligand, as well the difference in 
ASA for each atom. The total changes in non-polar
(all carbon atoms and sulfur atoms) and polar
(all oxygen and nitrogen atoms) are summed up. In addition, the
atomic change in ASA are
regrouped per residues (and per side-chain) for calculating
the change in S <SUB>conf</SUB>.
<P>
The module <B>thermo </B>calculates the energetics from the change in ASA.
The total change in ASA is the sum of the ASA<SUB>p</SUB> and ASA<SUB>np</SUB> 
which distinguishes between the contributions of polar and non-polar
atoms. These are then used to calculate the change in C<SUB>p</SUB> and 
H<SUP>o</SUP><SUB>d</SUB> for a desired temperature T. 
From the change in ASA of the different side-chains involved in the
dissociation, the conformational entropy gained for the ligand
and the enzyme is calculated. Finally, the total entropy change is 
calculated as the sum of all the entropic contributions.
