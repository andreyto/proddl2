*** Error, Unrecognized residue name:     577 S1  EMD     1     61.88000

Define this residue in the amino.def file if vanderwaal assumptions are wrong

or 

Module.: get_rix_index
Message: Cannot find '  ' in residue library.
</PRE>
One or more user pdb files contains an amino acid that STC does not
recognize. The user must modify the <B>lib/amino.def</B> file and add the
missing amino acids. Find this file in the stc installation and copy it to 
your current directory. Make the changes and then specify this new file in
the "Residue Library" field of the main stc window. An example of this type
of scenario is presented in <B> lib/examples/xuw </B>.
