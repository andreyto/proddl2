STC was first being formulated in 1996 when John Bagu began to
consider how thermodynamic analysis of the dissociation of protein
phosphatase-1 catalytic subunit and microcystin-LR docked complexes
could be done. Teaming up with Pierre Lavigne who had exceptional
interest in structural thermodynamics, they formulated a plan which could use 
a number of the routines already accessed/modified in the
software package <a href="http://www.bionmr.ualberta.ca/bds/software/vadar"> vadar </A>.
<P>
When I (Robert) heard of these researchers' ideas I offered to write the
straight forward thermodynamics section of the project.
The interactive c program 'thermo" was written in a couple weeks
and when combined with  
the accessible surface area routines, it appeared to work
quite well on John's data. To finish up vadar, I then offered to
write a second version  which used a simple <a href="tcl.html"> tcl 
</A> interface to gather the
input for thermo and display the output. With the gui, stc (which it
was now called) became a magnitude easier to use.

The microcystin paper was published in 2000. Pierre always believed the 
software had ramnifications which far exceeded the original purpose of the
work. However, with a small user base and a grant to further develop
the software being turned down, stc was in maintenance mode. Two versions
followed, both were small changes. Histograms were added in version 4.
<P>
In Nov 2003, I received two more emails regarding transition of stc to nucleic acids
and Pierre
happened to be visiting at this time. Somehow these events all conspired
to make me promise to do something about the state of stc. Once I got
started, I couldn't seem to stop as witnessed by the v5.0 release notes.
<P>
Mar 2006: After a couple years, it was time to go through my bug list,
update the documentation and add a gui for batch processing. This 
eventually led to version 5.3.
