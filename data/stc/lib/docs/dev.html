<H3> Some STC Programmer Notes <HR> </H3>

This section tries to look inside the blackbox of the STC package,
what the programs are, how they work, and how they are all tied together.
The resident wish program executes a <a href="tcl.html">
tcl/tk </A> script in stc-v5.0/tcl/main.tcl, this is a graphics front-end for
the stc suite. After gathering all
required input from the user, it eventually calls 
 <B>thermo</B> which is a c program which
performs all the thermodynamic calculations. <B>Thermo</B> is the independent
back-end of stc and a user could type <B>thermo</B> and be prompted for all
the input files required to perform the calculations. <B>Thermo </B> 
produces two output files, a short version which <B> stc </B> displays
in a window and a verbose file.

<P>
Of course, getting input files ready for <B>thermo</B> is a fairly complex
chore in itself. A shell script called <B>calc_asa</B> takes the
user's input pdb files and calculates the accessible surface area files
needed by <B>thermo</B>. The main program to do this is called <B>access</B>
which is a fortran program also used in  
<A href="http://www.bionmr.ualberta.ca/bds/software/vadar/index.html"> vadar</A>.
I have compiled <B>access </B> with the Fortran libraries built in
as not all machines have resident fortran libraries.
<P>
Getting pdb files into acc format involves the following. This is
convoluted of course and perhaps one day someone may wish to clean
this section up.
<OL>
<LI> <B>fix_pdb</B>, check and reformat pdb files. Discrepancies in naming convention
	  are delt with here.
<LI> convert pdb format to diamond format. (<B>pdbtodia</B>)
<LI> use a program modified by William Wilcox to add standard van der waals
(<B>addradii</B>). 
<LI> modify the addradii output to have van der waals which match the
amino acid library instead (<B>edpdb</B>).
<LI> call <B>access</B> with edpdb output to calculate accessible surface area.
</OL>
<P>

When building executables for sgi's, you have to keep in mind
the processor type, the version of Irix and the compiler flags
you set.  I have compiled this software on on an Octane R10000
running Irix 6.5. I seem to have less trouble with the Irix cc compiler
so I am sticking with that. I have had people tell me I can get
more efficient executables by including flags such as -mips3 but
then other people complain the executables don't work anymore on
their system (so i'm staying generic as possible).
