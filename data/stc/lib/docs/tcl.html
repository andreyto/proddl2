TCL (pronounced Tickle) is a simple interpretive programming language.
Tk (pronounced tee-kay) is a graphics toolkit callable from TCL.
TCL/Tk has been developed at the University of California at Berkeley
(UCB) funded by NASA, DARPA and by Digital in 1990.  It has been
placed in the public domain and add-on developments by third parties
encouraged. 
There are no licensing problems in using
TCL/TK in commercial applications.
<P>
TCL is designed to be embedded in applications written in C. If the
low level workhorse routines of the application are written in C and
the higher level controlling routines in TCL, then the application may
be readily re-configured or extended, much like Emacs is controlled by
a built in LISP interpreter.  The ISLE development already used a
Librarian and object store written in C++ so it was felt that there
was little need to embed TCL into C programmed structure tools.
Instead the structuring applications were written in entirely in
TCL/Tk and a communications extension to TCL:  TCL-TCP was used to
communicate with the librarian/object store. The Windowing shell
``Wish'' which reads TCL commands and executes them was therefore used
as the tool to both develop and run the tools.
<P>
TCL is an interpretative language, therefore debugging of applications
was found to be much easier as elements of code could be tried out
within the interpreter before being included in the actual TCL
program.  All variables were visible via the interpreter and any
patches required to the state of the application could be made to
allow execution and debugging to continue.
