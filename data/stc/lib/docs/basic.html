<H3> How to use stc on a basic example <HR></H3>

<OL>

<P>
<LI> Go to the stc installation directory and in <B> lib/examples </B>
you will see a directory called <B> basic </B>. Copy this directory
to your home directory. 

<P>
<LI>
List the directory and you will see there are two structures,
<A href="files/jrb.complex.pdb.html">jrb.complex.pdb</A> and
<A href="files/jrb.free.pdb.html">jrb.free.pdb</a>
Start the stc program by typing "stc".

> ls

<P>
Note that the <B>system type</B> for our data is "binding". One could also choose
"unfolding" or "oligomerization". Our examples library contains sample runs
of these system types.
<P>The <B>output directory</B> is where stc writes all the output files. The 
<A href="files/amino.def.html">residue library</A> is where we define the amino acids, nucleotides, and
parameters used in the calculations. Users with unique amino acids will
need to create a customized residue library. The directory <B> lib/examples/xuw
</B> is an example of this type of problem. 
<P> The <B>Calc ASA</B> button allows one to calculate accessible surface
area (ASA) output files. The <B>Thermodynamics</B> button lets the user
make thermodynamic calculations based on the ASA files. <B>Batch</B> is
a special case where the user wants ASA and thermodynamic calculations
to be applied to several pdb data files. 

<P>
<LI> <B> Click on the "Calc ASA" button. </B>
<P>

<P>
Because our system type is binding, 
we enter the bound complex pdb file and optionally enter
the free ligand and free enzyme pdb files.
<P>
Note: If the system type was "oligomerization", we enter the bound
oligomer pdb and an optional free monomer pdb. For the "unfolding"
system type, you enter both the folded and unfolded pdb files.

<UL>
<P>
<LI> <B> Click the "Calculate" button. </B>
<P> 
The program prints a number of messages to the screen telling you
what it is doing. The final message should say "Done calculations,
no errors".

<P>
<LI> <B> Click the "Display Results" button. </B>
<P>
<img src="images/asa.res.jpg">
<P>
A results window </A>
is displayed which allows you to view the various output
files. All accessible surface area output files have the ".acc"
file suffix. The log file is important because it indicates all the
steps and programs used to derive the ".acc" files and it indicates
the nature of any errors. Here are examples of an
<a href="files/out.ligand.acc.html"> acc </A> file and a
<a href="files/stc.log.html"> log </A> file.
When you are done, click on the  
"Dismiss" buttons until you arrive back at the first stc window.
</UL>

<P>
<LI> <B> Click the "Thermodynamics" button. </B>
<P>
<img src="images/thermo.jpg">
<P>
In this window we make thermodynamics calculations </A>
based on accessible surface
area files. Note that stc fills in the "ASA file" fields 
but the user can create or edit his/her own.  The other fields are
set such that stc calculates sConf in a reasonable way.
If you want to change
how stc calculates sConf from the default method, see
<a href="sconf.html"> calculating sConf</A>.

<P>
<LI> <B> Click the "Calculate" button. </B>
<P>

<P>
The program displays a 
<a href="files/out.basic.html"> basic output file </A>
of various binding constants and
other key variables. If you click on the 
<a href="files/out.detail.html"> detailed output file </A>
you can see thermodynamic output on specific atoms or residues.
Here is where you can study the individual atom differences,
the classification of polar/nonpolar atoms, a residue by
residue summary in the calculation of sconf (including the
change in ASA for total polar and non-polar atoms) and
the calculation of themodynamic paramaters per residue.
<P>
<LI> <B> Click the "Histograms" button. </B>
<P>
<img src="images/histo.jpg">
<P>
Finally, in order to analyze this output more easily, you can
click on the "Histograms" button where you can receive graphical
displays of the  
key thermodynamic indicators 
residue by resiude. Clicking on the radio button automatically
draws the requested histogram. 

<P>
Notes: <I>Unfortunately I am not able to
have the histogram redraw automatically when you resize the window,
thus i have a "fit to window" button which does it. I'm sure with
a bit of patience, this could be eliminated. Another bug is that
the histogram does not know what to do when the residue Ids are
not unique. Probably a future version of this software will have
options to select the appropriate chain.
</I>
<P>
<LI> <B> Click the "Save Postscript". </B>
<P>
Creates a postscript file of the plot. Remember that you have control
of the colors, titles, line widths, tics, of your histogram through the 
<a href="stcDefaults.html"> stcDefaults </A> file and that you have
the ability to re-locate any text via click/drag.
