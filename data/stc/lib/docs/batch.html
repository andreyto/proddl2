<H3> How to use stc in batch mode <HR></H3>

You have several structure files and you want to see which one
has the most favorable thermodynamics. This window allows the user
to do this quickly.

<P> First you want to place all of your pdb files in one directory
as shown in the <B>lib/examples/batch</B>. In this example,
the pdb files are
made up of a ligand and an enzyme separated by a TER statement.
When you are ready,
cd to that directory, type "stc"  and press the "Batch" button.

Currently there are not alot of options, the most interesting being that
you can choose which variables you want to display as the results are
being calculated. Your choice of variables come from the typical 
<a href="files/out.basic.html"> basic output file </A>.

Each pdb file is processed in alphabetic order, first ASA output files
are generated and thermodynamic calculations done with detailed results.
<P>
A one-line summary of the thermodynamic results is placed in the 
<a href="files/stc.batch.html">stc.batch results </A> file and it is the user's
responsibility to sort the file if need be.
<P>
Previous versions of stc included a <a href="files/old_batch_stc.html">
batch script </A> which users could
modify if you want to bypass the stc graphics window. This
should still be valid but it does take work to understand
how to set it up. An example dataset for which you can try this script is
found in <B> lib/examples/batch2 </B>.
