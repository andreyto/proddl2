Section 1-ASA (Accessible Surface Area) values
</B>
<P>
This section defines the polar and nonpolar ASA values for
the free ligand, bound ligand, free enzyme, and bound enzyme.
These values are presented in a table 1. The 
"free ligand ASA - bound ligand ASA" and
"free enzyme ASA - bound enzyme ASA" for both polar and nonpolar
quantities are what STC uses to calculate the thermodynamics of
binding. All changes in ASA are given in Section 2, Table 2.

Section 2-Change in ASA values
</B>
<P>
This section defines the change in ASA, nonpolar and polar, when
comparing the free verses bound ligand and free verses bound enzyme.
The difference in polar area upon binding for the ligand is then
added to the respective polar value for the enzyme. This total
change in ASA polar is what STC directly uses for thermodynamic
calculations. The difference in nonpolar area upon binding for the
ligand is then added to the respective nonpolar value for the enzyme. 
This total change is ASA nonpolar is what STC directly uses for
thermodynamic calculations.  These are global values, the dASA for
individual atoms and residues are listed in the detailed output
file Tables 1-4.

Section 3-Thermodynamic values
</B>
<P>
This section defines the thermodynamic values calculated from the dASA
nonpolar and dASA polar contributions from the ligand + enzyme. The
thermodynamic calculations listed are the global values, the individual
atom or residue values are listed in the detailed output file. For exact
details please see the <A href="theory.html"> 
<a href="http://www.proteinscience.org/search.dtl"> Stc paper 
</A>.
<P>
<B>DCpbind </B>is the heat capacity of
binding and should be a negative value (positive if viewed as
dissociation). This value is calculated from the dASA nonpolar and
dASA polar values. The unit for heat capacity is kcal/mol/K.
<P>
<B>DHbind</B> is the enthalpy of binding and can be positive or
negative. If it is positive then the enthalpy of binding is 
unfavorable, if negative then the enthalpy of binding is 
favorable (the opposite is true for dissociation). The enthalpy of
binding is calculated from the heat capacity of binding plus
the binding enthalpy at a reference temperature of 60 degrees C.
The unit for enthalpy of binding is kcal/mol. 
<P>
<B>DSbind </B> is the entropy of binding and can be positive or negative.
If this number is positive then the entropy of binding turns out to be 
favorable, if negative then the entropy of binding turns out to be
unfavorable (the opposite is true for dissociation). The unit for
entropy of binding is kcal/mol/K. The entropy of binding is a sum of
3 entropies that are listed below. The first is the solvation entropy,
DSsol, which is directly calculated from the dASA nonpolar and
dASA polar values (unit is kcal/mol.K). The second is the overall
rotational/translational entropy, DSrt, which has a set value of -0.008
kcal/mol.K. The third is the conformational entropy, DSconf, which in
itself is a sum of 3 entropies.  The first contribution to conformational
entropy is DSbu_ex, which is the change in conformational entropy of 
the side chains due to tertiary or quaternary interactions during
binding. The second contribution to conformational entropy is DSex_u,
which is the change in conformational entropy of the side chains due to
secondary structure changes upon binding. The third contribution to
conformational entropy is DSbb, which is the change in conformational
entropy of the backbone upon binding. The 3 types of conformational
entropy are generally unfavorable with respect to binding resulting
in a negative value having the unit kcal/mol.K.  The overall
conformational entropy of each residue is given in Tables 5 and 6 in
the output file containing the detailed results. The individual
contributions (DSbu_ex , DSex_u, and DSbb) to conformational
entropy per residue is also given in Tables 5 and 6 in the output
file containing the detailed results.
<P>
<B>TDSbind</B> is the entropy of binding at the temperature
where the structure was determined. This value is useful in calculating
free energy.
<P>
<B>DGbind </B>is the free energy of binding and it is calculated from
DHbind - TDSbind.  A negative value for DGbind indicates binding is
favorable, a positive value for DGbind indicates binding in not
favorable. From DGbind one can quickly calculate a Ka and Kd. Many
of these thermodynamic values are given for each residue in Tables
7 and 8 in the detailed output file.

This section displays the results for atoms having a change in their 
ASA when comparing the free ligand with the bound ligand and free 
enzyme with the bound enzyme. The first table shows the results for the
ligand, the second table is for the enzyme. Only atoms with a
change in ASA are shown.

Section 4- Calculating DSconf
<P></B>
This section displays the calculation for the conformation entropy
for each residue. This is done separately for the ligand and the
enzyme. It also includes the dSbu->ex, dSex->u, and dSbb values used
to compute dSconf per residue. dASATot is the sum of nonpolar dASA
and polar dASA for each residue. dASAsc is the change in ASA for the
side chain of each residue. The 
<a href="sconf.html"> next 3 entropy values </a> deal with 
structural changes in side chain or backbone conformations upon binding.
When added together they total dSconf.

This section gives the heat capacity of binding, the enthalpy of binding,
the different entropies of binding, and the free energy of binding for each

structure was calculated at (oK).
