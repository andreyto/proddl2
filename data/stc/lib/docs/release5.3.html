Release Notes for stc version 5.0 to 5.3
</H2>
<OL>

<P>
<LI> Implementation of the <B> batch button </B> to
process multiple pdb files. Provide example usage in lib/examples.

<P>
<LI> <B>The main screen shows the current residue library in use</B>.
This makes it easier for the user to find where the residues/atoms
are defined and whether the user agrees with the parameters set. Users
can set a custom residue library in the entry box provided or set it in the
./stc.defaults file.

<P>
<LI> <B>stc tcl/tk source code made available</B>. Perhaps there are
others who wish to expand stc.

<P>
<LI> <B>For calc asa, stc notifies the user about missing atoms </B>. In older
versions, stc would only make a note in the log file and move on.

<P>
<LI> Fixed bug involving the <B>customization of the residue library </B>.
In previous versions, adding a blank line to the residue
library caused edpdb to dump.

<P>
<LI> Fixed bug involving pdb files where the keyword TER has arguments
following it. I didn't realize that this was valid. Stc ignores any
arguments on the same line which starts with TER.

<P>
<LI> Software <B>copies stc.defaults to the users current directory</B>.
This should make it easier for users to understand what options they
can customize.

<P>
<LI> Fix C1 Glu atom in jrb.free.pdb example, should be CD. 

<P>
<LI> Simplify the installation script. Also remove the sbin directory, it
is easier to have one bin directory instead of bin (executables)
and sbin (scripts).

<P>
<LI> <B>Update documentation</B> and place STC example runs in lib directory.
More extensive example data are included.

<P>
<LI> Allow user to set the output directory on the main screen. This is
useful for the mac aqua version where /tmp is the default setting.
